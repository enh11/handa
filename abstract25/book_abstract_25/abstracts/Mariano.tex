\begin{abstract}
Motivated by recent advances in abstract theories of quadratic forms (ATQF), this work embarks on a discussion of matrices, linear systems, and vector spaces over superfields. The aim is to produce an expansion of Linear Algebra into the realm of multivalued structures.  Specifically, we introduce and analyze matrices and determinants within the framework of commutative superrings. We investigate linear systems and vector spaces over superfields. In particular, we show that: (i) every hyperbolic hyperfield (a fundamental concept in ATQF) is a  linearly closed superfields, therefore every finitely generated multivector space over a hyperbolic hyperfield have rigid bases and  all of them  have the same cardinality; (ii) the linearly closed superfields admits a reasonable notion of Kronecker construction associated to irreducible polynomials. As an application,  we have established an isotropy interpolation principle applicable to both algebraic and abstract theories of quadratic forms.
