During the talk we will focus on finite real hyperfields. In particular, we pay special attention to finite real hyperfields with cyclic positive cones. We present an algorithm for determining all such hyperfields up to isomorphism and compute their C-characteristic. We will also present the results of a computer program that provides examples and data on the number of such hyperfields of order up to 13, as well as the C-characteristics occurring in such hyperfields of order up to 17.
