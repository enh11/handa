\noindent \begin{abstract}Algebraically closed hyperfields are defined in the literature, by analogy with field theory, as hyperfields where all polynomials have a root. We consider an example of an algebraically closed hyperfield motivating a broader perspective on the definition of algebraically closed hyperfields. We speculate on the consequences of this broader perspective connecting it to the notion of existentially closed structures.
