\begin{abstract}
We initiate the study of the notion of \emph{support} for hypermodules over Krasner hyperrings, establishing several intrinsic connections with the concept of annihilators in this setting. After defining and characterizing the support of a hypermodule, particularly for finitely generated hypermodules, we employ the notion of hypermodule length to further explore its structure. As a main result, we determine the support of quotient hypermodules that contain a unique maximal hyperideal.
