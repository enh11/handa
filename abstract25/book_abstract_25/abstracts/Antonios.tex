\begin{abstract}
We introduce novel hypercompositional structures on fuzzy graphs by extending classical graph hyperoperations into the fuzzy domain. Building on the concept of strongest strong paths—those that are both optimal in strength and composed entirely of strong edges—we define two types of fuzzy hyperoperations: a vertex-based and an edge-based variant. These operations generalize established crisp hyperoperations and retain compatibility with the underlying graph topology.
