This study presents a characterization of the extra polyloop-3, i.e., a particular class of polyloops distinguished by the satisfaction of the third extra identity: $xy \cdot xz = x(yx \cdot z)$, in the classical non-associative algebraic structure, the one of extra loop. This gives an equivalence of seven identities in the corresponding algebraic non-associative hypercompositional structure, called extra polyloop-3. In contrast to the classical non-associative algebraic structures, the extra loops, where the binary operation satisfies any of the three extra identities, non-associative algebraic hypercompositional structures exhibit more distinctly dissimilar and complex behaviours. We study the interactions between the nonassociativity of extra polyloop-3 and other algebraic properties such as the flexibility law, left alternative property, right alternative property, and power associativity.
