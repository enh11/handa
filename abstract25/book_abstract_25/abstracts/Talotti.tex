\noindent \begin{abstract}
We propose a novel computational framework for implementing and analyzing hypercompositional structures using Boolean algebras and associated isomorphisms. This approach enables the representation of the hypercomposition table as integer valued matrices, facilitating their manipulation and structural analysis using native binary operations, such as AND, OR, and bit shifts, available in all modern programming languages. Our goal is to create a library written in Rust that enables the generation of algebraic hypercompositional structure, as well as the identification of some specific structure like (semi)hypergroups, transposition hypergroups, quasi-caonical and canonical hypergroups etc, and the investigation of the corresponding substructures. We also implement the identification of specific elements such as scalar elements, identities, scalar identities, etc.
