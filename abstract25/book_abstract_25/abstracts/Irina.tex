\begin{abstract}
In this presentation, I will explore several arithmetic functions defined on complete hypergroups. These functions possess a rich combinatorial significance and establish connections with graph theory, fuzzy set theory, as well as various topics in engineering and information technology. Specifically, I will discuss the fuzzy and intuitionistic fuzzy grade of a complete hypergroup, a generalization of Euler’s totient function, and the commutativity degree of a complete hypergroup. Finally, I will examine how these concepts relate to dependence relations, which will be the focus of the concluding part of the presentation.
