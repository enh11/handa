Algebraic structures play a fundamental role in mathematics and have a wide range of applications. However, analyzing the properties and behavior of an entire algebraic structure can often be complex and challenging. To make this task more manageable and focused, researchers frequently study specific substructures or subsets such as ideals, filters, or anti-ideals.This talk explores algebraic structures through the lens of various types of anti-ideals. These subsets often involve an inherent degree of vagueness or uncertainty. To address this, we introduce their fuzzification, which provides a more flexible and realistic framework for describing such processes within algebraic systems.
