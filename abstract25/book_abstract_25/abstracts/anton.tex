\begin{abstract}
In this presentation, we are going to talk about three types of hypernear-rings and their main characteristics. First, we will look at hypernear-rings and their elements that “correct” the lack of distributivity, in other words we deal with the elements that assume the validity of distributivity. Next, we will cover division hypernear-rings, which form a special class with unique features. Lastly, we will present findings on general hypernear-rings that are associated with a hypergroup.
