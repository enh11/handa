In this talk, it is characterized supplementing Krasner hypermodules in the subcategory $_{R_{h}}hmod$ . It has been proven that the hypermodule, whose the subhypermodule and the factor hypermodules with its subhypermodule and factor hypermodule are supplementing hypermodules, is itself a supplementing Krasner hypermodule. The transfer of hyperrings in the category $_{R_{h}}hmod$ to factor hyperrings has been associated with supplementing hypermodules. It has been demonstrated that supplementing hypermodules with normal projective and reduced have small radicals.
